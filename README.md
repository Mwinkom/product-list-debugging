## Application Structure

- **Product List**: Displays dessert items in a responsive grid (3 columns on desktop/tablet, 1 column on mobile)
- **Cart Component**: Shows selected items, quantities, and total price
- **Add to Cart**: Interactive controls for adding items and adjusting quantities
- **Order Confirmation**: Modal that appears after confirming an order

## Component Architecture & Communication

### Services
- **CartService**: Manages cart state using BehaviorSubject for real-time updates
  - Provides methods for adding, removing, and updating cart items
  - Persists cart data in localStorage
  - Exposes cart items as an Observable for components to subscribe to

- **OrderService**: Handles order processing and confirmation
  - Manages order state using BehaviorSubjects
  - Communicates with CartService to process orders
  - Provides methods for calculating totals and managing order confirmation

### Component Communication
- **@Input/@Output Pattern**:
  - ProductCard receives dessert data via @Input
  - AddToCart component emits events when items are added via @Output
  - OrderConfirmed component receives order data via @Input

- **Observable Pattern**:
  - Components subscribe to CartService and OrderService observables
  - Real-time updates when cart items change or orders are processed
  - Automatic UI updates through Angular's change detection

- **Event Communication**:
  - Custom events for synchronizing add-to-cart buttons with cart state
  - Event listeners for handling item removal across components

## Key Technologies

- **Angular 19**: Framework for building the application
- **SCSS**: For styling with variables and mixins
- **LocalStorage**: For persisting cart data between sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **RxJS**: For reactive state management with Observables and BehaviorSubjects
